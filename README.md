"# Cast Your Heart Out! - 112-Term-Project" 

This project is a wizard game that uses voice input to cast spells
*Please use headphones for a proper experience with the game/pitch detection

Your main objective in this game is to survive against hordes of zombies in a confined room.
To survive, you must cast spells to either run away, heal yourself, or kill the zombies

Please start in Learning Mode, as the controls for this game are relatively complicated.
PAY ATTENTION TO THE INSTRUCTIONS. YOU CANNOT PLAY THE GAME OFF OF INTUITION.

To learn the spells in Learn Mode, you must go around the map and interact with the objects around you.
They will give you clues as to what the spells are. Interact with the right ones to unlock spells.

There are minor threats in Learn Mode, as that mode is made to help players learn
The bulk of the game is contained in the Wave Mode. That's where the challenge begins.
If you ever forget the spells while playing Wave Mode, on the pause menu you can access the combinations for the spells.

These are the instructions in-game:

'Pay attention to these instructions. Press right arrow key to move to next. To skip (not recommended), press "E".', 
'Your objective as of right now is to discover all the color combinations for the spells around this apartment', 
'You can do so by interacting with objects in this environment, which will give you clues as to what those color combinations are',
'Pressing "E" on your keyboard will allow you to interact with these objects',
'Interacting with the right objects will give you access to specific spells (but right now you don\'t have access to any)',
'To cast spells, you must record a specific combination of colors',
'Notice, there\'s a cooldown bar for the spells you cast on the top left corner',
'To begin recording your color input, press "C", and to finish giving color input, press "C" again. If that combination corresponds to a spell, it will be cast.',
'After pressing "C" to record, you must switch between colors to record a specific color combination. In pressing "C" once more, the combination recorded will be evaluated.',
'You can switch between colors with your voice. The higher your voice goes, the further up in the color meter it will go (top left corner of screen) and vice versa.',
'It is recommended to sing in falsetto and around the note G4 and above to get more accurate voice detections',
'To open/close microphone, press "R". Try it',
'There are two circles on the bottom right of the screen. The left circle shows if mic is open/closed (red/gray). The one on the right shows if a note was detected (green if yes, red if no)', 
'If you are having difficulties with the voice detection, close your microphone and use the arrow keys to give your color input (more info in controls screen)',
'For more information about controls, press "esc" to pause and access controls screen.',
'Good Luck!'

    As for the rest of the art, including UI and character sprite, I made them all myself with Piskel
    I also made all the sounds (As you probably noticed).
